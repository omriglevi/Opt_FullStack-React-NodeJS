# React-and--RestAPI
This app's frontend is buid by React-Hooks and Backend by rest API , the State is managed with Redux . 
The Backend accepts all kind of requests  including GET wich makes it very functional but also makes is UNSECURED comparing to other API me Because this RestfulAPI 
method revaling our queries when we send a GET request it is much better to work with. POST request and JSON body !!!! - IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE FOR UNDERSTANDING APIS AND ITS METHODS BUT IT IS MORE SECURE TO 
USE ONLY POST REQUEST FOR KEEPING QUERIES SECURED AND HIDDEN AND USE AS LESS ENDPOINTS AS POSSIBLE . THE ACTUAL API CAN BE FOUND IN THE ROUTES FOLDER
The Database is local MongoDB .
