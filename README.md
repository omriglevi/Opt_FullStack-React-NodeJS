# React-and--RestAPI
This app's frontend is buid by React-Hooks and Backend by rest API , the State is managed with Redux . 
The Backend accepts all kind of requests (GET , POST ...) wich makes it very functional but also makes is UNSECURED comparing to other API methods like GrapqhQl, Because this RestfulAPI
method revaling our queries when we send a request to our api  !!!! - IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE FOR UNDERSTANDING APIS AND ITS METHODS BUT IT IS MORE SECURE TO 
USE ONLY POST REQUEST FOR KEEPING QUERIES SECURED AND HIDDEN AND USE AS LESS ENDPOINTS AS POSSIBLE .
The Database is local MongoDB .
